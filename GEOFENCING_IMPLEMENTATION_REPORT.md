```kotlin
// From GeofenceBroadcastReceiver.kt
private suspend fun sendTelegramMessage(context: Context, message: String) {
    val telegramService = TelegramService(context)
    if (telegramService.isLoggedIn()) {
        // Send message via existing Telegram service
        telegramService.sendMessage(message, onSuccess = {}, onError = {})
    } else {
        // Fallback to notification
        showFallbackNotification(context, message)
    }
}
```

#### Home Activity Integration
Added navigation button to access geofencing features:
- Button added to `activity_home.xml` layout
- Click handler implemented in `HomeActivity.kt`
- Seamless navigation to `GeofenceActivity`

## Technical Implementation Details

### Permission Management
The system handles complex Android location permissions:

```xml
<!-- AndroidManifest.xml -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION" />
```

**Runtime Permission Handling**:
- Requests location permissions when needed
- Handles Android 10+ background location permission requirements
- Provides user-friendly permission explanation dialogs

### Google Play Services Integration
Utilizes Google Play Services for robust geofencing:

```kotlin
private val geofencingClient by lazy {
    LocationServices.getGeofencingClient(context)
}

fun addGeofence(geofence: Geofence) {
    val geofencingRequest = GeofencingRequest.Builder()
        .setInitialTrigger(GeofencingRequest.INITIAL_TRIGGER_ENTER)
        .addGeofence(geofence)
        .build()
    
    geofencingClient.addGeofences(geofencingRequest, geofencePendingIntent)
}
```

### Data Persistence
Geofences are stored using SharedPreferences for persistence across app sessions:

```kotlin
private fun saveGeofence(geofence: GeofenceData) {
    val sharedPrefs = context.getSharedPreferences("geofences", Context.MODE_PRIVATE)
    val gson = Gson()
    val json = gson.toJson(geofence)
    sharedPrefs.edit().putString(geofence.id, json).apply()
}
```

### Background Processing
The system operates efficiently in the background:
- Uses `BroadcastReceiver` for minimal resource consumption
- Implements coroutines for asynchronous operations
- Maintains geofence monitoring even when app is closed

## User Experience Flow

### 1. Initial Setup
1. User navigates to "Geofences" from home screen
2. App requests location permissions if not granted
3. Google Maps interface loads with current location

### 2. Geofence Creation
1. User taps on map to select location
2. Fills out geofence form:
   - Name/description
   - Custom message to send
   - Radius (50-1000 meters)
3. Geofence appears on map with visual circle
4. Saves to persistent storage

### 3. Automatic Monitoring
1. System monitors geofences in background
2. When user enters/exits area:
   - Automatically sends Telegram message
   - Shows notification for confirmation
   - Includes timestamp and location info

### 4. Management
1. View all geofences in list format
2. Delete unwanted geofences
3. Visual representation on map

## Error Handling and Fallbacks

### Robust Error Management
- **Network Issues**: Graceful handling of API failures
- **Permission Denied**: Clear user guidance for permission granting
- **Telegram Unavailable**: Fallback to system notifications
- **Location Services**: Prompts to enable location services

### Notification Fallbacks
When Telegram messaging fails, the system provides:
- Rich system notifications with geofence information
- Error logging for debugging
- User feedback about system status
